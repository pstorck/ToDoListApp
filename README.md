# To-Do List Application #

### Summary ###
This project is a simple To-Do List Application created as a proof of concept for designing 
applications using Spring Boot, GraphQL, Apollo Client and Angular. Users are able to add,
check off or delete tasks from their to-do list.

### How To Use ###
This Spring-Boot backend can be run with the command ```./mvnw spring-boot:run``` from the top
level directory. The Angular frontend can be run by navigating to the ```./src/main/client/```
directory and then running the command ```npm start``` and going to ```http://localhost:4200```
in a browser.

### What I Learned ###
- Creating a GraphQL API using Spring Boot
- Designing a GraphQL schema containing created Types, Queries and Mutations
- Accessing said GraphQL API through the Apollo Client for Angular
- UI design/styling through use of Angular Material components
